# RAM Allocation Utility
I've seen some articles detailing how to launch Minecraft with more than the default 128-512 MB of RAM allocated to it to improve performance; doing this greatly improved the performance for me.

Noticing that it was tedious to determine how much memory I wanted to use for Minecraft and entering the appropriate command at the command line every time I wanted to launch Minecraft, as well as feeling that existing launchers with a RAM allocation feature seemed a bit involved for such a simple purpose as this, I decided to develop an application that would allow me to perform this process with minimal user input.

This is still in the very early stages of development, but it works well enough for me that I thought I should publish it in case anybody wants it.

The utility can be used by opening the file in Notepad, editing the location for the Minecraft executable on the second line (it defaults to C:\Minecraft.exe), and saving it to the location where you want the Minecraft icon.

Tested with Minecraft 1.2.5 on Windows 7 64-bit; as far as I know, it should work with all Minecraft versions on Windows XP+.
